abstract="This chapter provides a short overview of driving automation for on-road vehicles from the standardization point of view with a focus on various levels of automation. The content of this chapter gives information about current technical standards and future standardization topics. Furthermore, it gives a plea for worldwide harmonized standardization and legislative efforts regarding automated driving in near future. The main target is to reach a harmonized regulatory approach for automated driving at the European Union (EU) level that would allow for innovation and, also, improve safety, efficiency, and environment while preserving the comfort of the passengers.",

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous vehicles are expected to play a key role in the future of urban transportation systems, as they offer potential for additional safety, increased productivity, greater accessibility, better road efﬁciency, and positive impact on the environment. Research in autonomous systems has seen dramatic advances in recent years, due to the increases in available computing power and reduced cost in sensing and computing technologies, resulting in maturing technological readiness level of fully autonomous vehicles. The objective of this paper is to provide a general overview of the recent developments in the realm of autonomous vehicle software systems. Fundamental components of autonomous vehicle software are reviewed, and recent developments in each area are discussed.},
