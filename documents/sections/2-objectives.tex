This master's thesis aims to address critical challenges in \aclink{BEV} semantic segmentation and its practical applications within autonomous driving systems. Initially driven by the core inquiry into optimal \aclink{BEV} segmentation strategies, the work evolved to explore both fundamental performance comparisons and a tangible application.
